The Exception model includes the following fields:

- start_time: Start time of the exception
- end_time: End time of the exception
- num_hours: Number of hours for the exception
- reason: Reason for the exception, with a minimum length validation of 50 characters

The module also includes the Meta class for defining database table name, ordering, and verbose names.

Note: The Assessment and InServiceTraining models are currently commented out and not in use.
