module: nhhc.signals

The module `signal_handlers.py` contains signal handler functions that are designed to respond to specific events or triggers within the application. These signal handlers are connected to various Django model signals to execute custom logic when certain actions occur.

Signal Handlers:
    - create_ancillary_profiles_signal
    - password_change_signal
    - employee_terminated_signal
